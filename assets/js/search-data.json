            "content": "It&#39;s been ages since I&#39;ve been thinking to start a blog. To keep in touch with my friends, to express my thoughts, to write when I am at night. Several times I looked into the easiest ways to get started. It took a pandemic (covid19) and fastpages to get me started, but here I am! (fastpages is awesome, check it out). . Last summer, when I went back to Romania after a 12 year gap, it was striking how much I felt like a visitor. But not really a visitor, because I&#39;m attached to those places, the mindset, that way of being. And while I was staying up at night, I realized that my identity is dominated by me being an immigrant, a STEM immigrant. And I decided that moment that when I start my blog, that&#39;s going to be the theme. . I plan to write regularly, maybe a post a week, on average. I will add one music clip to each post. Music is universal, it touches us more than maybe any other form of art. I also hope music is accessible. . The reality of my existence is that I will not feel at home anywhere. I am married to a Brazilian, I have a small American at home, we currently live in a suburb of New York city. The only thing we have in common is our diversity. . When I heard Madeleine Payroux playing this song live, I understood that the lyrics define exactly the raw emotions I feel about who I am. Enjoy! . No soy de aquí, ni soy de allá No tengo edad, ni porvenir Y ser feliz es mi color de identidad . .",
